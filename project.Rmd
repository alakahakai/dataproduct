#### Project Overview

For the Developing Data Products Course Project, I have developed a Shiny Application for drawing the country map of the state selected by the user.

##### How to use the application

The usage of the application is very simple.  Just pick the state from the select input box and the county plot will be displayed on the main panel automatically.

##### Viewing and Running the Shiny App

The application is posted on Rstudio's shiny server at: https://rayqiu.shinyapps.io/dataproduct

#### Give it a try and have fun! :-)
